- Installation Documentation -

Requirements:
    - Preferably some sort of *nix
    - Python 2.7.x
    - Virtualenv
    - Some kind of compiler for the postgresql dependencies?

Quick set-up howto:
    - Clone the repository off of github or grab the source code for the project otherwise
    - Setting up a virtualenv with distribute and the needed dependencies:
        * 'virtualenv --distribute folder_name'
            (Creates a virtual environment into directory "folder_name")
        * 'source folder_name/bin/activate'
            (Loads this virtual environment up in your current shell)
        * Move to the project's root directory, where the requirements.txt resides
        * 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            (Installs all the dependencies into this virtual python environment)
    - Set up basic settings:
        * Copy settings.py.template to be settings.py in tsoha/
        * Set up the database information in settings.py (search for 'DATABASES')
            (Simplest to set up is sqlite, set ENGINE to django.db.backends.sqlite3,
             and NAME to the local file system file name of the database you want to
             use. The file will be created if it doesn't exist already)
    - Try syncdb'ing:
        * 'python manage.py syncdb'
            (Checks if database is connectable and creates the tables needed)
            (You might be asked to create a superuser for administration)
    - Try importing basic content into the database:
        * 'python manage.py loaddata doc/initial_data.json'
            (Imports the basic data in doc/initial_data.json to the database)
    - Run the django web server for basic testing!
        * 'python manage.py runserver'
        * Connect to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ for the actual forums, or
          to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ for (low-level) administration.
